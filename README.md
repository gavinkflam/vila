====

My dockerized portable development environment.

Out of the box
--------------
Packed with neovim, tmux, zsh, oh-my-zsh, ag, docker-cli, etc..

Minimal
-------
Each project should be self-contained and containerized.

Interactions are restricted through docker-cli and the binded Docker socket.

Thus, allowing a clean and minimal core of the development environment.
